A formula for evaluating the rate of occurrence of failures is derived. As an application, a maintenance model for a two-component parallel system, in which component 1 after repair is not 'as good as new' but component 2 after repair is 'as good as new', is studied."

This paper investigates the rate of occurrence of failures (ROCOF) of finite state semi-Markov systems. Firstly, a formula for evaluating the ROCOF for semi-Markov systems is derived. As a consequence of this result, we derive the ROCOF of Markov systems as well as the ROCOF of the alternating renewal processes and we give their asymptotic values. From the semi-Markov ROCOF formula, we propose a statistical estimator of this function. Finally, the uniform strong consistency and the asymptotic normality of this estimator are obtained."
