Equation \ref{MatMRE} can be evaluated by direct numerical integration or using Laplace transforms method. Most distributions do not possess a closed form Laplace transform. \cite{Gulyas2007} in a thesis dissertation employed a transform approximation method (TAM) to evaluate the Laplace transform of Weibull distribution and then numerically evaluated its Laplace inversion. In this project, we resort to the direct numerical integration technique.

Equation \ref{eq:staying} is computationally expensive if the integral has to be evaluated for each $t$. Instead, it can be computed as a recurrence relation as follows:
\begin{align}
W_i(t_n)=\begin{cases}
1 - \int_0 ^ {\Delta t} {w_i(t_n) dt} & n=1 \\
W_i(t_{n-1}) -\int_{t_{n-1}}^{t_n} { w_i(t) dt}    & n > 1
\end{cases}
\end{align}


Where, by trapezoidal rule, we have:
\begin{align}
\int_{t_{n-1}}^{t_n} {w_i(t)}dt = \frac{\Delta t}{2}\{  w_i(t_{n-1}) + w_i(t_n)  \} 
\end{align}

To solve the system of integral equations, \cite{Nunn1977} derived the following recurrence relation based on trapezoidal rule by distributing $t$ on a set of equally spaced points in the interval $[0,t]$:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\phi (t_n )} = [I - \frac{{\Delta t}}{2}C(0)]^{ - 1} [diag(W(t_n )) + \nonumber \\
\Delta t\sum\limits_{k = 1}^n {C(t_k ){\phi (t_n  - t_k )}}  - \frac{{\Delta t}}{2}C(t_n ){\phi (0)}]
\label{TrapCTMRE}
\end{eqnarray}
Where $\Delta t = t_n - t_{n-1}$. The solution is started with ${\phi(0)} = W(0) = I$.

The convolution operation in the above equation involves repeated addition and multiplication of matrices thus slowing down the computations as $n$ grows. With sufficiently large storage space, the following technique for convolution improves the speed:
\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{k = 1}^n C(t_k )&{\phi (t_n  - t_k )} = \nonumber \\
& \begin{bmatrix}
C(t_1) &  C(t_2) & ... & C(t_n)
\end{bmatrix}
 \begin{bmatrix}
{\phi(t_{n-1})} & {\phi(t_{n-2})} ... {\phi(t_0)}=I
\end{bmatrix}^T
\end{align}
